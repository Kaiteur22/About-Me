        <h2>Singing</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite hobby of mine is to sing. I have been singing since I was
          5, when I got the lead for our kindergarten graduation song. Singing
          has always been therapeutic for me as there is always a song to fit
          your mood at any given time.
