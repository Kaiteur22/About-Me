        <h2>Singing</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite hobby is to sing. I have been singing since I was 5, when I got the lead for our kindergarten graduation song. As I got older I was asked to sing at my middle school graduation, friends birthdays and family weddings.  
        </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite singers are:

          <li>Jazmine Sullivan</li>
          <li>Ari Lenox</li>
         </ul>
         Singing has always been therapeutic for me as there is always a song to fit
         your mood at any given time.These women have always been an inspiration because they are able to use there talent to convey emotions where words are sometimes not enough. Though I am not a professional singer I am thankful that my voice has been able to bring joy to those around me.

       <h2>Hair Styling</h2>
       <p>
        Hair styling is one of those hobbies that started because of my interest in  my mothers work. My mom has been a hairstylist for ove 25 years. My interest began while I was young, because I would go to work with her and see the different styles she would give her clients.

        These days I stick to Locs, natural hair and weaves for close friends and family. There was a time when I wanted to be  hairstylist fulltime, but there are 3 things you need to be successful that I just dont have:
