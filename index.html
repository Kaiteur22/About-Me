        <h2>Singing</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite hobby is to sing. I have been singing since I was 5, when I got the lead for our kindergarten graduation song. As I got older I was asked to sing at my middle school graduation, friends birthdays and family weddings.  
        </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite singers are:
         <ul>
          <li>Fantasia</li>
          <li>Jazmine Sullivan</li>
          <li>Ari Lenox</li>
         </ul>
          Singing has always been therapeutic for me as there is always a song to fit
          your mood at any given time.These women have always been an inspiration because they are able to use there talent to convey emotions where words are sometimes not enough. Though I am not a professional singer I am thankful that my voice has been able to bring joy to those around me.
